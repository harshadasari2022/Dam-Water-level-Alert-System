**Dam Water level Alert System**

**Problem Statement:**

Floods caused by excessive water in dams pose a serious threat to life and property. Manual monitoring of dam water levels is prone to delay and human error. Therefore, an automatic real-time system is needed to sense water levels and issue alerts when dangerous levels are reached.

**Results: **

•  When the water level exceeds the threshold, the red LED turns ON, the buzzer activates, and the LCD displays "Water Level: HIGH"

•  When the water level is below the threshold, the green LED turns ON, the buzzer remains OFF, and the LCD displays "Water Level: OK"

•  The system accurately simulates a real-time dam water level monitoring and alert mechanism and performs as expected in the TinkerCad simulation.
